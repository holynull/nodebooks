RSI_API_DOCS="""Relative Strength Index (RSI)
Base URL is https://api.taapi.io/rsi
The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the price of a stock or other asset. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph that moves between two extremes) and can have a reading from 0 to 100.
The RSI provides signals that tell investors to buy when the security or currency is oversold and to sell when it is overbought. 
API PARAMETERS
secret is the secret which is emailed to you when you request an API key. 
Note that the secret is: {taapi_key} 
exchange is the exchange you want to calculate the indicator from: gateio or one of our supported exchanges. For other crypto / stock exchanges, please refer to our Client or Manual integration methods.
symbol is default means the coin to USDT. It is always uppercase, with the coin separated by a forward slash and USDT: COIN/USDT. For example: BTC/USDT Bitcoin to Tether, or LTC/USDT Litecoin to Tether...
interval is interval or time frame: We support the following time frames: 1m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h, 2h, 4h, 12h, 1d, 1w. So if you're interested in values on hourly candles, use interval=1h, for daily values use interval=1d, etc.
MORE EXAMPLES
Let's say you want to know the rsi value on the last closed candle on the 30m timeframe. You are not interest in the real-time value, so you use the backtrack=1 optional parameter to go back 1 candle in history to the last closed candle.

Get rsi values on each of the past X candles in one call:
Let's say you want to know what the rsi daily value was each day for the previous 10 days. You can get this returned by our API easily and efficiently in one call using the backtracks=10 parameter:

PSAR_API_DOCS="""Parabolic SAR
Base URL is https://api.taapi.io/psar 
The Parabolic SAR (Stop and Reverse) is a popular technical indicator used in financial markets to identify potential trend reversals. Developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr., it utilizes a series of dots plotted on a price chart to highlight potential entry and exit points.
The Parabolic SAR dots are positioned above or below the price, depending on the direction of the prevailing trend. When the dots are below the price, it indicates an uptrend, while dots above the price indicate a downtrend. The dots gradually adjust their position as the price evolves, creating a parabolic shape. Traders often use the Parabolic SAR as a tool for setting stop-loss orders and trailing stops, as it dynamically adapts to market conditions and can help identify potential trend reversals in a timely manner.
In the Parabolic SAR formula, users have the flexibility to adjust three optional parameters: start, increment and maximum. The start parameter determines the initial acceleration factor for the indicator. The increment parameter specifies the rate at which the acceleration factor increases over time. Lastly, the maximum parameter sets the upper limit for the acceleration factor. By modifying these parameters, traders can customize the sensitivity and responsiveness of the Parabolic SAR indicator to suit their trading strategies and market conditions.
