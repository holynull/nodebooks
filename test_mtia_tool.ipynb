      "The Parabolic SAR (Stop and Reverse) is a popular technical indicator used in financial markets to identify potential trend reversals. Developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr., it utilizes a series of dots plotted on a price chart to highlight potential entry and exit points.\n",
      "The Parabolic SAR dots are positioned above or below the price, depending on the direction of the prevailing trend. When the dots are below the price, it indicates an uptrend, while dots above the price indicate a downtrend. The dots gradually adjust their position as the price evolves, creating a parabolic shape. Traders often use the Parabolic SAR as a tool for setting stop-loss orders and trailing stops, as it dynamically adapts to market conditions and can help identify potential trend reversals in a timely manner.\n",
      "In the Parabolic SAR formula, users have the flexibility to adjust three optional parameters: start, increment and maximum. The start parameter determines the initial acceleration factor for the indicator. The increment parameter specifies the rate at which the acceleration factor increases over time. Lastly, the maximum parameter sets the upper limit for the acceleration factor. By modifying these parameters, traders can customize the sensitivity and responsiveness of the Parabolic SAR indicator to suit their trading strategies and market conditions.\n",

      "Base URL is https://api.taapi.io/psar \n",
      "The Parabolic SAR (Stop and Reverse) is a popular technical indicator used in financial markets to identify potential trend reversals. Developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr., it utilizes a series of dots plotted on a price chart to highlight potential entry and exit points.\n",
      "The Parabolic SAR dots are positioned above or below the price, depending on the direction of the prevailing trend. When the dots are below the price, it indicates an uptrend, while dots above the price indicate a downtrend. The dots gradually adjust their position as the price evolves, creating a parabolic shape. Traders often use the Parabolic SAR as a tool for setting stop-loss orders and trailing stops, as it dynamically adapts to market conditions and can help identify potential trend reversals in a timely manner.\n",
      "In the Parabolic SAR formula, users have the flexibility to adjust three optional parameters: start, increment and maximum. The start parameter determines the initial acceleration factor for the indicator. The increment parameter specifies the rate at which the acceleration factor increases over time. Lastly, the maximum parameter sets the upper limit for the acceleration factor. By modifying these parameters, traders can customize the sensitivity and responsiveness of the Parabolic SAR indicator to suit their trading strategies and market conditions.\n",
